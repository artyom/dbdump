Command dbdump saves contents of tables in a given MySQL database to
per-table CSV files with optional gzip compression.

dbdump saves either specified or all database tables which are readable by
the connected user; if only subset of table columns is readable, only these
readable columns are saved.

By default program saves multiple tables over multiple connections (see -n
flag), if consistency between dumped tables are required, use -tx flag do
save them sequentially in a single transaction.

MySQL credentials (user and password) are read from the "client" section of
the .my.cnf file which is expected to have the following format:

    [client]
    user = username
    password = password

When running in concurrent mode, program returns when it processes all
tables, but only reports the first error it encounters. When running in
single transaction mode (-tx flag), program terminates on the first error
right away.

Only database, table and column names that can be used as unquoted MySQL
identifiers are supported â€” they are only allowed to contain characters from
[A-Za-z0-9_] range.
