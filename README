Command dbdump saves contents of tables in a given MySQL database to
per-table CSV files with optional gzip compression.

dbdump saves either specified or all database tables which are readable by
the connected user; if only subset of table columns is readable, only these
readable columns are saved.

By default program concurrenlty reads multiple tables over multiple
connections (see -n flag), if consistency between dumped tables is required,
use -tx flag to save them sequentially in a single transaction.

MySQL credentials (user and password) are read from the "client" section of
the .my.cnf file which is expected to have the following format:

    [client]
    user = username
    password = password

When running in concurrent mode, program only returns when all tables are
processed reporting the first encountered error. When running in a single
transaction mode (-tx flag), program terminates on the first error right
away.

Only database, table and column names that can be used as unquoted MySQL
identifiers are supported â€” they are only allowed to contain characters from
[A-Za-z0-9_] range.

Null values are saved in CSV as NULL.
